# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Model
A comprehensive model for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using computer vision techniques, aimed at exploring the capabilities of neural networks in image processing and classification.

# Project Overview
- This project involves creating and training a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits.
- The dataset used is the MNIST database, a large collection of handwritten digits, which includes 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.

# Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- The dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
- Each image is represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixel intensities.
- Preprocessing steps include normalizing these pixel values for neural network efficiency and reshaping the images when necessary, particularly to add a color channel for certain types of neural networks.

# Model Architecture
- The model is built using Keras, with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
- It includes convolutional layers for feature extraction from images, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for the final classification.
- Activation functions, optimization algorithms, and other hyperparameters are chosen to enhance the model's learning capability.

# Training and Evaluation
1. The model is trained on the preprocessed training data, adjusting weights to minimize classification error.
2  It's then evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance in recognizing unseen handwritten digits.
3. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated to gauge the model's effectiveness.

# Application and Future Scope

- This model can be integrated into various applications like digital document analysis, automated form processing, etc.
- Future enhancements could include experimenting with different neural network architectures or more complex datasets.
